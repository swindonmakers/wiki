The Bridgeport requires induction.

The Bridgeport has been converted from three phase to single phase using a Siemens Micromaster 420 VFD. The internal transformer has also been switched from the 380V to 240V primary coil to allow the controls, contactors and accessories to operate correctly.

The VFD is attached to the motor output contactor via a resettable overload set to ~3.5A. This takes the single phase (as delivered by the machine tool circuit from the consumer unit by the front door), and converts it to a simulated three phase. A remote control panel has been built to control power, speed and direction. This is connected via an umbilical with a 7 pin XLR connector into the base of the wall mounted VFD enclosure.

Pinout to be added later, currently on paper inside door pocket of mill.
