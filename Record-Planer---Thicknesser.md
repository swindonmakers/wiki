The Record thicknesser/planer requires induction - even if inducted on the Titan planer/Thicknesser as the operation is significantly different. Put a request in the inductions group.

The thicknesser side is used to plane wood down to a specific thickness with parallel faces. The planer side is used to create a right angle edge to already planed / thicknessed wood also referred to as jointing as it is common process prior to gluing boards together e.g. to make a bench or table tob. 

Planing / Thicknesser is useful for cleaning up reclaimed wood (pallets etc), and making warped wood straighter. **please note** all (new and recycled) material should be carefully checked for any nails, screws, staples, bullets prior to planing. Even new material often has price tags stapled to it.

The thicknesser/planer requires sawdust extraction using the mobile unit. It produces enormous amounts of wood chips, so the extraction unit should be regulary checked to ensure it does not back up. Extraction is required not only to collect chips but also to prevent the machine jamming.
