_As mentioned in a [previous post](/blog/2013-07-03-meeting-report/ "{{ site.url }}/blog/2013-07-03-meeting-report/"),
the hackspace has been working on getting an old [Heathkit Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERO_(robot)) robot up and running._

We are almost starting to build up a mini library of printable Heathkit Hero 1 parts. The latest edition is not so much a replacement but a component fix that should allow a broken robotic arm to be repaired and re-attached. A common problem is the area around the shoulder attachment of the arm body where the plastic goes brittle with age.

<!-- more -->

Whilst this repair will obviously make your robot un-original, it will salvage any broken arms and allow Hero to be fighting fit for an arm wrestle again. It has been designed sympathetically and if printed with grey plastic, it should blend in well and make Hero appear like it's on steroids.

Other replacment printable parts for Heathkit Hero 1 designed at the Swindon Hackspace include new Grippers and a Wrist Joint :-
