# Tips on writing documentation for Swindon Makers Wiki

There is no preferred format for writing documentation. Use whatever you feel comfortable with, though ideally the format should be generally available across platforms and devices. It also obviously needs to be able to be locatable on the web.  

### Github Markdown 
The Wiki itself is written in [Github Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github), which is a good choice to get started.  ( You need to sign up to github to get started.)
  
### Google Docs
 If you like to work in google Docs, select the Share -> Publish to Web option and use the resulting link. This allows the document to be read without someone needing to sign in to google. (You also have the option to update automatically when you edit the document or republish).
