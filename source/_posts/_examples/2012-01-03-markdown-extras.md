summary: Some non-standard markdown extensions

---

The markdown renderer used for this site is [kramdown]. It adds many advanced extensions
to the syntax, some of which are demonstrated here.

## Common Extensions

*Many non-standard "flavours" of markdown feature these common extensions.*

Empty brackets after a reference link can be omitted - so long as the meaning is
unambiguous.  e.g. instead of [github][], you can use [github].

[github]: http://github.com

Similar to reference style links, are footnote links[^moreinfo].

[^moreinfo]: here is some more info, that will appear at the bottom of the page.

Automatic creation of [header IDs] makes it easy to link to various
[sections](#common-extensions) within your post.

[header IDs]: http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/converter/html.html#auto-ids

Tables can be created easily, additional formatting such as text alignment
[can also be used](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/quickref.html#tables).

|header 1|header 2|header 3|
|--------|--------|-------:|
| data 1 | data 2 | data 3 |


## Kramdown Extensions

*These extensions are less common, but can be very useful for a website.*

Attributes allow for modifying [block] and [span] level elements.

[block]: http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/quickref.html#block-attributes
[span]: http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/quickref.html#inline-attributes

One use of attributes is to append class names to elements:

![CentredImage](https://github.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png){:.center}

Another is to add custom formatting without using HTML, such as *underline*{:.underline},
*strikeout*{: style="text-decoration: line-through"}, and *colour*{: style="color: red"}.

A [table of contents] can be generated by using the `toc` reference. Normally this would
be used at the start of a long post with lots of headings.

* This list item will be replaced with the table of contents.
{:toc}

### Header with an explicit header ID  {#manual-id}

Manually specify a header ID by following it with `{#name}`.

Explicitly end a block-level element with an EOB marker (a line containg only `^`):

    This is the first code block

    This is also the first code block
^

    This second code block is separated by the EOB marker above.

Definition lists have a syntax that's similar to normal lists:

term to define
: a definition
: an alternate definition


### Text Transformations

Plain ASCII can be used for typographic symbols: ellipsis ..., em-dash ---, en-dash
--, and guillemet << / >>. Prepend characters you don't want converted with `\`.
